    "1. **School Course Statistics** such as whether it teaches comptuer science or not, how many computer science courses does it teach, how many computer science enrollments were recorded for the year. \n",
    "\n",

    "These instructions will be of help when you want to prepare data for a visualization in future years. The original file format provided by OSPI may slightly change but this is a good reference point to see our method.

This increases the total number of rows as well as makes it difficult for us to see the statistics for a course easily in one row. Therefore we are going to spread the data such that each letter grade becomes its own column. This will also help us in calculating the total students easily. I have printed the head of the `scc_courses` dataframe for you to easily see the changes made.**"
